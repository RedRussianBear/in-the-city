# *In The City*
#### *A Story from the Forty First Millenium*

It is the 40,798th year of the Imperial Era, and the 3,547th after the settling of the Searmus System. Around the system's ruddy red
sun orbits a single small rocky planet, recorded in the voluminous ledgers of the Administratum as SEAR-4767, but known to it's 
inhabitants simply as "The Foundry". Far beneath the smog and soot from its myriad mines, refineries, and manufactories, midst the murk
of the warehouses, the grime of the workshops, and the fumes of unknown origin, one can discern a hub of activity and life: a city.
It's name is New Babylon, and this is its story.

## I. The City




## III. That Night

People die by the hundreds every night in New Babylon. People are shot, people are run over by transmechs, people are crushed by machinery,
people are suffocated by toxic gases. And a few succumb to natural causes. But not a soul knows why, of all the bars in all the sleepy
neighborhoods of all the planets in the whole dark tomb of space, it was that one bar, that one night, that errupted in green flames, 
killing all inside. What authorities could be found to express an interest couldn't fathom an explanation for the 64 dead at Harlock's
Dive at the intersection of Autofactory Street and 47th Avenue, Level III.
